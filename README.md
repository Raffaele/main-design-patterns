Design patterns explanation

## Definition
A **design pattern** is a general, reusable solution to a common problem that occurs within a specific context in software design. It's not finished code, but rather a template or blueprint that can be adapted to solve a particular design issue in your program.

### Key points
* **Proven**: Based on best practices developed over time by experienced developers.
* **Reusable**: Helps solve problems that appear again and again in software architecture.
* **Communicative**: Provides a shared language for developers to discuss solutions (e.g., “Let's use the Singleton here.”).
